Ever wondered a vehicle which can traverse on all sorts of rough terrain including artificial environments like stairways. Here we are with such a project which can do wonders and certainly be helpful for the society.
	Just using basic principles, we designed a stair climbing bot which can climb the stairs easily with load.This robot can be controlled by a bluetooth controlled transmitter and it can cross any hurdle, even though the hurdle is in front of only one wheel. This robot is quiet flexible while crossing the hurdles.To climb stair, it is necessary to pay attention to different aspects of the mechanical and electronical difficulties to make it work.

Material Required:
1) PVC pipes
2) PVC pipe joints(90 deg.,120 deg.)
3) Jumper Wires
4) Bread Board
5) 3 x Lipo Batteries(12V)
6) 6 x Wheels(8 cm)
7) DC motors
8) Motor Drivers(RKI-1341)
9) Arduino Uno
10) Bluetooth Module HC-05
11) 2 x Servo Motor

DESIGN 

The bot is moving on its six wheels powered by high torque DC motors which enables it to climb up the stair with an ease. The bot is equipped with a self adjusting plate on its top(just like a camera gimbal) which helps to keep the load always in horizontal position. 
The rear arms are rigid while the front arm (basically an elbow joint) is flexible and free to rotate about a horizontal axis thus enabling the front part to get lifted up whenever it encounter a stair. The bot is manually controlled by bluetooth module.

ACHIEVEMENTS

1.The project is in working stage.
2. A balancing plate has been installed which remains horizontal always even during the time of climbing stair thus keeping the load in place.
